    "#Terrorist Alliance Model\n",
    "##Goal: \n",
    "Alliances are both costly and beneficial to militant groups. Allied groups benefit from trade and returns to efficiency from joint production of violence. They share information and infrastructure. But maintaining an alliance requires resources, and sharing secure information entails vulnerability. We therefore expect to see groups being highly selective about the alliances they make. \n",
    "The topology of communities in the structure of the militant group alliance networks is highly varied. What explains the variation in terrorist network structure? This model will try to reproduce this variation by exploring the dynamics shaping alliance choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the set of theorized decision rules, does alliance formation produce efficient outcomes? In other words, are groups selecting into alliances that maximize their utility? Do they find communities that make them better off, or are the resulting alliances inefficient? Does this depend on time? \n",
    "\n",
    "##Justification:\n",
    "Alliance formation is a network problem, because the actions made by any given group affect all of their partners. It is an agent based model because groups vary in their strength, and their interaction with any given group depends on their interaction with other agents. \n",
    "Alliance formation is not an equilibrium process. Groups continuously break and form alliances in the real world. An agent based model will help us to understand the dynamics by looking at snapshots, rather than looking for unreachable equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "##Outline:\n",
    "-Implement counter terrorist\n",
    "\n",
    "-Implement terrorist network, which contains terrorists\n",
    "\n",
    "-Tune the model parameters so that costs and benefits are on the same scale\n",
    "\n",
    "-Vary counterterrorist resources (risk), the strength of saturation costs, and the strength of network benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "-Observe how various network attributes change over time. Do communities become more centralized, or are they flat? \n",
    "\n",
    "#Model Comonents\n",
    "##Space:\n",
    "The actors exist in a non-dimensional space in which they interact according to a random draw. They have the option to form alliances, after which they exist in a network, which goods and risks can flow across.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Actors:\n",
    "###Counter Terrorists:\n",
    "Counter terrorists target transnational groups in two ways. First, they pick some constant number of new groups every period to investigate. Second, they use intelligence from previous operations to select groups. Allies of groups they targeted in the previous round have some probability of being targeted in the next round, with the probability dependent on the first group's strength, with stronger groups better safeguarding information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Counter terrorists have a list of targets, but also have limited resources. Among their targets, they select some capped number of groups to attack with their current intelligence. By the next period, the intelligence has expired, and they must select new potential targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Terrorists:\n",
    "Each period, terrorist groups with capacity to form additional alliances, (groups with remaining open alliance slots,) probabalistically interact with a set number of other groups, and consider an alliance with each. The group will select among the others that it interacted with in order to choose the group, if any, that provides the best utility increase. If the potential partner has no alliance openings, it will only form an alliance and discarding its least prefered group provides greater expected utility than the status quo. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Decisions:\n",
    "Groups make alliance decisions based on their expected utility. Utility is calculated as the eigenvector centrality of the group's component scaled by its eigenvalue, and a tuning parameter. Eigenvector centrality was used because it represents the flow of broadcast network goods across a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Groups also incur two types of cost. The first is a saturation cost: having an alliance is costly to maintain. This is equal to the a scaled degree centrality. The second is risk. I begin with an adjacency matrix weighted by the probability that a group will transfer intelligence to the counterterrorist when attacked. I take the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue corresponding to a group's component, and multiply it by the cost of being attacked if attacked \n",
    "\n",
    "##Initial conditions\n",
    "###Counter-terrorists:\n",
    "Counter terrorists begin with 0 targets. They randomly select a certain number to target, then select among them to attack\n",
    "###Terrorists:\n",
    "Terrorsits begin with no alliances, and no utility. Over time they beuild their first network, and this network shifts over time. \n",
    "#Model Parameters: (and their defaults)\n",
    "-tune: These are tuning parameters that are used to bring all the costs and benefits in each terrorist groups utility function to be on the same scale. The tuning parameters are: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-niters=1000: number of time periods in the model. Set iters because not just interested in equilibrium outcome. Want to look voer time. \n",

    "\n",
    "num_choices=5:The number of groups that a group choooses between when deciding whether to form an alliance. How many options are drawn for that group to choose among?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Progress:\n",
    "The model currently encompasses vulnerability and saturation costs, but does not encorporate commitment problems or competition, which may result in only a single type of alliance. My next step will be to introduce competition, and see how that changes alliance formation dynamics. "

For example, eigenvector centrality, which is currently the payoff groups receive benefit, is small, so groups will never form any alliances since the saturation costs and risks will outweigh the benefits. If the tuning parameter is too high, a fully saturated network, (saturated instead of complete because it is subject to constrained edges per node,) with alliances always being preferable. \n"
