My main code sample is the SyriaCivilWarTweets notebook, in which I collect 
tweets mentioning groups in the Syrian Civil War and run some preliminary 
exploratory analyses.

Additional Samples
I have enclosed three additional scripts that showcase different skillsets.
They cover three languages, formal modeling, object oriented code, basic 
network analysis, and time series.
-Mil Alliance Model: Written in Python 2, this is the basic framework 
	for a computational formal network model that I am building. It 
	is very much a work in progress, with the code lagging the paper theory
	by a couple of itrations, but it has the basic interface and a 
	barebones structure that I am building on. Right now it is 
	very slow, but it serves as an interface and working model as 
	I finalize the theory and make adjustments to the model itself. 
	I will optimize as I implement my final strategic tradeoffs and 
	utility functions. Eventually, output of the model will be 
	compared to real dynamic militant group network data to explore 
	common motifs.
-MilitantNetworkAnalysis: This is a matlab script preparing data for a network
	analysis for a study on the determinants of militant group violence 
	and tactical choices. In it, I create network covariates for my analysis.
-TimeSeries: This is an R script doing some preliminary analyses on time series data.
	The intent was to practice finding patterns and playing with time series.
